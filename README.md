# botnet_detection
The primary goal of this project was to develop an effective machine learning–based systemfor botnet detection using the UNSW-NB15 dataset. Through systematic preprocessing, feature selection, and the implementation of two advanced stacking ensemble models—Boosting Stacking and Hybrid Stacking—the system successfully identified malicious network traffic with high accuracy and robustness. The project began by analyzing the motivation behind botnet detection, addressing the increasing cybersecurity threats to modern networks and IoT infrastructures. Existing methods, including the KSDRM model, were studied to identify their limitations, particularlytheir limited use of modern boosting-based learners and reduced adaptability to evolvingattack patterns. To overcome these challenges, the proposed approaches integrated multiplebase learners—Random Forest, LightGBM, CatBoost, and XGBoost—with different metalearners: Logistic Regression in the Boosting Stacking model and XGBoost in the HybridStacking model. These configurations aimed to exploit the complementary strengths of tree- based and boosting algorithms for improved classification reliability
